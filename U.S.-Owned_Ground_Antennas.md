# U.S.-Owned Ground Antennas for Satellite Operations

## Introduction
This page provides an overview of the ground-based antenna systems owned and operated by the United States, which play a crucial role in satellite communications, control, and data downlink. These antennas are part of a global network that supports a wide range of activities, including Earth observation, telecommunications, navigation, and scientific research.

## Ground Antenna Networks
The U.S. operates several networks of ground antennas across the globe, including those managed by government agencies such as NASA, the Department of Defense, and commercial entities. Below are some of the key networks and their primary functions:

### NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN)
- **Description**: The DSN is a worldwide network of large antennas that support interplanetary spacecraft missions, as well as some orbiting Earth.
- **Locations**: Consists of three deep-space communications facilities located approximately 120 degrees apart around the world in Goldstone, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia.
- **Capabilities**: Provides communication and tracking services for space missions beyond Earth orbit.

### Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN)
- **Description**: Operated by the United States Space Force, the AFSCN provides support for the operation, control, and tracking of U.S. military satellites.
- **Locations**: Comprises numerous ground stations across the world, including both fixed and mobile antenna sites.
- **Capabilities**: Offers telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) services for military satellites.

### Commercial Ground Stations
- **Description**: Numerous commercial entities in the U.S. own and operate ground antennas to support commercial satellite operations, including telecommunications, Earth observation, and weather satellites.
- **Key Operators**: Companies like SpaceX, ViaSat, and Hughes Network Systems.
- **Capabilities**: These antennas facilitate a wide range of services from broadband communication to data downlink for satellite imagery.
