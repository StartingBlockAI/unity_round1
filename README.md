# Satellite System Digital Twin in Unreal Engine

## Overview
This project aims to create a high-fidelity digital twin of a satellite system using Unreal Engine. The digital twin will serve as a comprehensive simulation, visualization, and interaction platform for the satellite system, providing real-time insights and analytics. By leveraging Unreal Engine's powerful rendering capabilities and real-time physics simulation, this project will offer an immersive experience for both developers and stakeholders involved in satellite system operations.

## Objectives
- **Simulation**: To accurately simulate the satellite system's behavior in orbit, including its dynamics, interactions, and operations within a virtual environment.
- **Visualization**: To provide a visually compelling and interactive 3D representation of the satellite system, facilitating enhanced understanding and analysis.
- **Interactivity**: To enable user interaction with the digital twin for educational, training, and operational planning purposes.
- **Analytics**: To integrate real-time data and analytics into the digital twin, allowing for live monitoring, performance analysis, and decision support.

## Scope
- **Satellite Models**: Detailed 3D models of the satellite components, capturing the intricate designs and functionalities.
- **Orbital Dynamics**: Simulation of the satellite orbits, including their paths, velocities, and orientations relative to Earth.
- **Environment**: Creation of a realistic space environment around the satellites, including Earth, celestial bodies, and other relevant environmental factors.
- **Operational Systems**: Implementation of the satellite's operational systems within the simulation, including communication, navigation, and data transmission.
- **User Interface**: Development of a user-friendly interface for interacting with the digital twin, including control panels and data visualization tools.
